# ossummit-austin-2016

This is support files for my 'Docker and Cinder' talk at the 2016 Openstack Summit in Austin, Texas.

This stuff uses an M4.xlarge instance on AWS, and it's extremely important that that instance has a large disk attached to it, say like 100G - everything will fail if the disk isn't big enough to host a 40G m1.medium instance!

Things to know:
 - this relies on my own public key, hosted on riotnrrd.com
 - this relies on a custom-baked QCOW2 image, also hosted on riotnrrd.com
 - this probably just straight-up won't work for you.
